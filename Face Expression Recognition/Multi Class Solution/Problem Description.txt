a) It is 48 x 48 grayscale images of faces (pixel intensities)
i.e. [-row1 -- row2 --row3 ----] => (1, 2304) 
b) The faces are centered and approximately same size
c) Each face shows an emotion and our job is to classify these emotions-

0 = Angry
1 = Disgust
2 = Fear
3 = Happy
4 = Sad
5 = Surprise
6 = Neutral

It's a three column csv file: label, pixels (space-centered), train/test

Note: Images have pixel intensities 0... 255 (8 bit integers have 2^8 = 256 different possible values). We need to normalize these to be from 0...1

We want this narrow range because activation functions of neural networks like sigmoid / tanh are most active in the -1 to +1 range.
