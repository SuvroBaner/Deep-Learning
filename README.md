# Deep-Learning
A systematic study of Deep Learning 

This repository will be dedicated to the study of Deep Learning. So, I will start from the Pre-requisites and then slowly build  the concepts. This is based on a series of courses I have been taking (Jan 2017 ...) on Udemy from Lazy Programmer Inc. The courses look promising and will surely invoke a creative child in you. So, buckle up and enjoy...
The courses I'll try to cover are below. I'll upload the repositories based on my own progress with the Udemy Courses. If you are more interested pls visit https://www.udemy.com/user/lazy-programmer/
